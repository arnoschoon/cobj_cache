TYPO3 Individual cObject Caching, inspired by the extension of Fabrizio Branca (http://www.fabrizio-branca.de/typo3-individual-cobject-caching.html)

The original extension on forge (http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-cobjcache) has IMHO some shortcomings. Since the backport to the TYPO3 4.5 branch was never done I decided to implement this little extension. TypoScript notation is the same as the examples in Fabrizio's blog post.
